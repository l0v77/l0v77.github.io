I am a student in my final year of graduate studies at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), specializing in Robotics and Autonomous Systems within the Department of Mechanical Engineering.

During my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at VisionX in the summer of 2023 as a full-stack engineer. Collaborating closely with the company's computer science team, I played an integral role in migrating their website. Additionally, I took the lead in developing a plant disease diagnosis platform for one of their esteemed clients.
