I am a student in my final year of graduate studies at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), specializing in Robotics and Autonomous Systems within the Department of Mechanical Engineering.

During my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at [VisionX](https://visionx.world/) in the summer of 2023 as a full-stack engineer. Collaborating closely with the company's computer science team, I played an integral role in migrating their [website](https://visionx.llc/). Additionally, I took a part in developing a [plant disease diagnosis platform](https://smartplanting.net/) for one of their clients.

Prior to my graduate studies, I earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/). During my time there, I was honored with the Senior Experience in Engineering Design Student Choice Award, a recognition for a [seed](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/seed) capstone project that significantly impressed my peer engineering students.
