I am a student in my final year of graduate studies at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), specializing in Robotics and Autonomous Systems within the Department of Mechanical Engineering.

During my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at [VisionX](VisionX.world) in the summer of 2023 as a full-stack engineer. Collaborating closely with the company's computer science team, I played an integral role in migrating their [website](visionx.llc). Additionally, I took a part in developing a [plant disease diagnosis platform](https://smartplanting.net/) for one of their clients.
